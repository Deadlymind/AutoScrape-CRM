# AutoScrape-CRM

Sure, let's break down A1 into detailed steps:

### A1: File Creation

#### Method 1: Annucapt Software

1. **Initiate Annucapt Software**:
   - Open and configure Annucapt software for the task.

2. **Keyword and Region Input**:
   - **Input Keywords**: Enter the keyword for the search.
   - **Enter Region**: Manually input the region (e.g., Paris, Nouvelle-Aquitaine).
     - **Automation Goal**: Develop a script to automatically cycle through a list of regions for each keyword.

3. **Captcha Handling**:
   - **Manual Step**: Solve Captchas when prompted by the software.
     - **Automation Goal**: Integrate a third-party Captcha solving service (e.g., 2Captcha) to automate this process.

4. **Data Scraping**:
   - The software scrapes data from the specified database (e.g., French Yellow Pages).
   - **Extracted Data**: Company name, website, email address, postal address, company size, NAF code, director's name, phone numbers, company type, creation date.

5. **Email Deliverability Test**:
   - The software tests the deliverability of the collected email addresses.
   - **Separation of Emails**: Separate deliverable and non-deliverable email addresses.

6. **Extract Additional Emails (if needed)**:
   - **From Websites**: Use Advanced Web Email Extractor to gather emails directly from company websites.
   - **Google App Import**: Use a Google Sheets add-on to import data from web searches.

7. **Manual Email Search**:
   - **Google Search**: Manually search for email addresses using Google.
   - **Facebook Search**: Manually search for email addresses using Facebook.

8. **Compile Results**:
   - Compile all gathered data into a single file.

#### Method 2: Kompass Database

1. **Initiate Search**:
   - Open Kompass and start a new search.
   
2. **Keyword and Region Input**:
   - **Input Keywords**: Enter the keyword for the search.
   - **Select Region**: Select the region manually.

3. **Data Scraping**:
   - Use Google Chromeâ€™s Instant Data Scraper extension to scrape data.
   - **Extracted Data**: Company name, description, website, postal address, phone number.

4. **Process Data**:
   - Follow the same email verification and additional email extraction steps as Method 1.

#### Method 3: Google Maps

1. **Initiate Search**:
   - Open Google Maps and start a new search.

2. **Keyword and Region Input**:
   - **Input Keywords**: Enter the keyword for the search.
   - **Enter Region**: Specify the region manually.

3. **Data Scraping**:
   - Scrape data from Google Maps search results.
   - **Extracted Data**: Company name, website, postal address, phone number.

4. **Process Data**:
   - Follow the same email verification and additional email extraction steps as Method 1.

### Steps to Automate:

1. **Automate Keyword and Region Cycling**:
   - Develop a script to cycle through a predefined list of regions for each keyword input.

2. **Integrate Captcha Solving**:
   - Use a service like 2Captcha to handle Captchas automatically.

3. **Consolidate Data Extraction**:
   - Create a unified script that handles data scraping from all sources (Annucapt, Kompass, Google Maps).

4. **Email Verification**:
   - Integrate real-time email verification APIs during the scraping process.

5. **Additional Email Extraction**:
   - Automate the use of Advanced Web Email Extractor and Google Sheets add-ons for additional email extraction.

6. **Manual Search Automation**:
   - Develop tools or scripts to partially automate Google and Facebook searches for email addresses.

### Detailed Steps for Implementation:

#### Step 1: Automate Keyword and Region Cycling

- **Script Development**: Write a Python script to automate the input of keywords and regions into the Annucapt software.
- **Task Scheduling**: Use task scheduling tools like Celery to manage the sequence of region inputs for each keyword.

#### Step 2: Integrate Captcha Solving

- **API Integration**: Integrate a Captcha solving service (e.g., 2Captcha) into the scraping script.
- **Automated Captcha Handling**: Configure the script to detect and solve Captchas automatically during the scraping process.

#### Step 3: Consolidate Data Extraction

- **Unified Scraping Script**: Develop a single script that can handle data extraction from Annucapt, Kompass, and Google Maps.
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Ensure the script dynamically inputs keywords and regions, manages Captchas, and extracts the required data fields.

#### Step 4: Email Verification

- **API Integration**: Integrate email verification APIs (e.g., ZeroBounce, Hunter) into the scraping script.
- **Real-Time Verification**: Configure the script to verify emails as they are extracted, separating deliverable and non-deliverable emails.

#### Step 5: Additional Email Extraction

- **Automate Tools**: Automate the use of Advanced Web Email Extractor and Google Sheets add-ons for secondary email extraction.
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Develop a fallback mechanism to handle cases where initial methods do not yield email addresses.

#### Step 6: Manual Search Automation

- **Semi-Automated Tools**: Create semi-automated tools to assist with manual Google and Facebook searches.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Optimize these tools to reduce the time spent on manual searches and improve accuracy.

By following these detailed steps, you can effectively automate the A1 file creation process, minimizing manual intervention and enhancing overall efficiency. If you need further details or specific code examples for any of these steps, feel free to ask!
